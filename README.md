# JSL03 Project Brief: Console-Based Task Manager

## Important Prerequisite
1. I have reviewed and corrected my JSL02 project using the provided solution.
2. Task entry prompts are fully functional, ensuring proper validation checks for accurate user input.
3. I have reviewed the project user stories in my student dashboard to understand each required feature.


## Overview
This project establishes a simple yet structured task management system, enabling users to add up to three new tasks to an existing task array. Each task is stored as an object within the array, uniquely identified by an incremental ID for seamless tracking.

### Core Functionalities:
- Task Entry via Prompts: Users input details such as title, description, and status directly.
- Validation & Alerts: Ensures proper input handling and notifies users when the task limit is reached.
- Task Filtering: Allows users to view only completed tasks for streamlined management.
- Console Logging: Displays all tasks in an organized manner, with a dedicated section for completed tasks.

### Key Focus Areas:
- Array Manipulation: Efficiently managing tasks within structured data.
- User Interaction: Handling input through prompts and providing responsive feedback.
- Task Status & Filtering: Enhancing usability by enabling users to focus on completed tasks.

## Key Objectives

## Logic & User Interaction

- Store tasks as **objects inside an array** for structured data management.
- Allow users to **add up to three new tasks** to the existing task list.
- Ensure each new task has a **unique incremental ID** based on the last task in the array.
- Prompt users to enter **task details (title, description, status)** and store them in an object.
- Alert users when they reach the task limit with the message:
  _"There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console."_
  Implement a **filter function** to display only tasks with the status `"done"`.
- Log **all tasks** in the console with a clear label for easy review.
- Log **only completed tasks** (status: `"done"`) in the console under a "Completed Tasks" label for quick reference.

## Code Quality & Maintainability

- Meaningful variable and function names enhance readability and maintainability.
- Consistent indentation and formatting ensure clarity in code structure.
- Comments explain key logic and functionality, making future modifications easier.

## Languages Used !
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

## Set Up For Project
- Go to my github : **https://github.com/kuhle2018/LINMOY25104_FTO2502_A1_Lindokuhle-Moyakhe_JSL03.git**
- Fork the repository.
- Clone the repository. 
- Ensure HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT and live server extensions are installed before getting started.

## Expected Outcome
- A **structured and limited task management system** that enables users to add, review, and filter tasks efficiently 
while ensuring **clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.**

**Console Log of all and completed tasks**
